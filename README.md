Discussion and voting on specific issues

When ready to vote on an issue (typically after public discussion), add
a comment with voting checkboxes:

```markdown
* [ ] @encukou
* [ ] @erlend-aasland
* [ ] @mdboom
* [ ] @serhiy-storchaka
* [ ] @vstinner
* [ ] @zooba
```

Then, each member will:

* Check the box for “+1”.
* Comment after their name with “abstain”, “-1”, etc.

Proposals are accepted if & when they get all “+1” or “abstain” votes.

Votes time out after a month with no activity, with weekly pings:

* at least 1 week after the vote is opened, or after their last comment if
  they made one after the vote is opened, the member should be @-mentioned
  in a comment so they get a notification.
* at least 1 week after that mention, they are mentioned again.
* at least 1 week after that mention, they are mentioned yet again.
* 1 week after the third ping, they count as abstaining.
